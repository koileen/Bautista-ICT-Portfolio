        <td style="text-align:center;font-size:20;color:white;"> I play a few games. One of the games I play is Genshin Impact. It's one of the games I really like. 
            I started playing it during pandemic which was 2020. I really like the playstyle and the characters. My favorite characters are Kazuha, Scaramouche, and Lyney.
             I really love their lore and their design.</td>

        <td style="text-align:center;font-size:20;color:white;"> Toilet Bound Hanako Kun or also known as Jibaku Shonen Hanako Kun is one the the 
            animes I'm really fixated in. I like the art style, plot, and characters. 
            This anime was introduced to me by a friend which I already lost contact with. My favorite character 
            in this anime is Tsukasa and Amane or Hanako kun. They're both twins!</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="text-align:center;font-size:20;color:white;"> Another anime I like is Haikyuu. It's a volleyball anime I watched
        also during quarantine. I used to be very obsessed with the characters in this anime. I like all of the characters but I really like Oikawa and Sakusa.
    I like Oikawa because I relate to him a lot. I like Sakusa because of how well his character was written.

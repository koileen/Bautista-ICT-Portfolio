                This second quarter in ICT 9, i’ve learned quite a few things despite being absent for a whole 2 weeks this quarter. First, <br>
                I learned to get used to self learning once again since I can’t always depend on my teacher to adjust to my needs just because  <br>
                I couldn’t catch up to the lessons discussed. I learned to take the consequences of my actions. Next, I learned how to cram and  <br>
                procrastinate less, making use of my free time for academics. Using only HTML can be hard and messy in the code, luckily  <br>
                Ms. Uminga taught us CSS which made my codes a lot cleaner and have a prettier website. Though I still couldn’t get used to being  <br>
                time pressured during hands on activities as I never finished the ones given to us. I hope next quarter I can adapt. I am thankful  <br>
                that our teacher is very considerate. She sometimes gives in to us whenever we ask politely to move the deadline of the things assigned to us. <br>
                Sometimes, she gives hints in our tests which is already a big help to us since most of us struggle with her tests. Another thing I learned  <br>
                is that I need to not only memorize the lessons but also fully understand it to its fullest. I also need to be very observant in tests,  <br>
                especially when we need to figure out what’s wrong in the given code. Lastly, I learned to always stay healthy, because getting sick means  <br>
                I have to stay home from school and it will mean I have to miss all the things that will happen. Catching up with the lessons and backlogs  <br>
                are hard so I will try my best to stay healthy to always be able to attend school.

        <p size="29" color="white"> I like a lot of things since i am really indecisive and I take interest in a lot of things. </p> <br>
        <p style="align:left;font-size:15;font-color:white> One of the things I like is penguins and ducks becuase my two favorite members <br> in 
            Enhypen is Nishimura Riki and Park Sunghoon and their animal representative is a duck and penguin. <br>
            Additionally, I like penguins because in third grade, we were tasked to make an animal <br> using clay during science class 
            and I did a penguin. My teacher recognized my work and displayed it in the classroom.

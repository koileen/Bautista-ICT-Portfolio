        <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20;color:white;font-family:georgia;"> I like a lot of things since i am really indecisive and I take interest in a lot of things. </p>
        <table align="center" cellpadding="50" width="65%">
    <tr>
        <td style="align:right;font-size:20;color:white;font-family:georgia;"> One of the things I like is penguins and ducks becuase my two favorite members <br> in 
            Enhypen is Nishimura Riki and Park Sunghoon and their animal representative is a duck and penguin. <br>
            Additionally, I like penguins because in third grade, we were tasked to make an animal using clay during science class 
            and I did a penguin. <br> My teacher recognized my work and displayed it in the classroom.</td>

            <td style="align:;font-size:20;color:white;font-family:georgia;"> I also like reading and writing fanfictions in my free time. It's a calming activity and it helps me relieve stress. I like writing because I like controling the things that happen to the characters in the story. </td>
    </tr> </table>
            <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20;color:white;font-family:georgia;">I have a lot of food that I like, especially when it's sweet and frozen so I cant list them down since theres so many. <br> 
                I'm a kpop stan so naturally, I really like albums and photocards. I might've even spent too much money on it. <br>
                Of course, I cant forget my phone. It's the one thing I always have in my hand no matter where I go.
                Some of the apps I like is <br> Wattpad, Tumblr,c Tiktok, Instagram, Facebook, and Shopee. I really like the cold weathers since it brings me comfort. <br>
                And also because I hate the sun. I would do anything for the sunlight to not touch me. Lastly, I like horror things such ad movies and <br> some horror places.</p>

    <p style="color:white; text-align:center;font-size:20;"> 
        This quarter, I learned many things just like my classmates. I learned about lists, tables, 
        XHTML, and forms. Although I did struggle, <br> I managed to make all of them work in my website. 
        I had to ask many people such ad my classmates, friends, and sister. I wasn’t really blessed with 
        the <br> talent of coding so I had a hard time. In this quarter, I found out that I had to practice 
        how to code fast and accurate in order to obtain a high grade.<br> I was put into so much pressure 
        during hands on activities, but it also taught me many things, like how not to panic and just 
        stay calm while typing really fast. <br> I also learned that size doesn’t matter, although length does. 
        I don’t really like how long the codes suddenly got as compared to the codes I was used to during 
        grade 8. <br> Overall, I experienced fun, stress, and pressure during this first quarter, but I learned many 
        things. And all of those were thanks to my teacher, Ms. Uminga.</p>
